## Projects
### Data Science and Application - Integrating speech-enabled services in Web applications

- The project made use of the Whisper model to train and fine-tune a custom ASR model, which was evaluated under different conditions to ensure its reliability and robustness.
- Applied data modelling and transformation techniques (**Data cleaning**) in preparation of the data to be **Extracted, Transformed and Load (ETL)**.
- All project objectives were achieved with the use of **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **PyTorch**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** to implement the web interface and build a backend that allows the third party (banking web page) access to the built speech recognition system.

### Pneumonia-virus Detection and Analysis in Chest X-ray of COVID-19 Images Using Machine Learning Techniques

- Developed a **Matlab** machine learning model for detecting viral pneumonia in chest X-ray images that includes normal pneumonia cases and viral pneumonia cases.
- Achieved project objective with the use of image improvement analysis techniques such as **image contrast and noise reduction**.
- Preprocessing techniques such as **histogram equalization**, **anisotropic diffusion filtering**, and **thresholding using Otsu's method** were you to preprocess image data.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model trained and tested at a ratio of 80:20 split data, respectively, returned an accuracy score of 93.26%, showing that it can reliably tell the difference between normal pneumonia cases and viral pneumonia cases.

### Exploratory Data Analysis of Environmental Data from sensor technology
- Preprocessed the data by removing missing values and Malfunctioning devices (Data Cleaning).
- Visualised the data to spot trends and relationships with the use of **scatterplots and timeplots** and the use of **Boxplots** to identify anomalies.
- Observation showed a moderate positive correlation between temperature and humidity and a weaker negative correlation with infrared temperature.
- Exploration addressed variability across devices, variability by yearly quarters, hourly variability and the  relationship between variables.
